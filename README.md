# C++ Data Structures

This repo contains code I wrote From 2 C++ Classes at FAU:
 - COP3014 Foundations of Computer Science
 - COP3530 Data Structures
    - Some of the Data Structures code is adapted from the textbook source code for my own learning purposes: [ADT's, Data Structures, and Problem Solving With C++, 2E](https://cs.calvin.edu/activities/books/c++/ds/2e/).

 I mostly used the open-source [Code::Blocks IDE](https://www.codeblocks.org/) for both courses.
